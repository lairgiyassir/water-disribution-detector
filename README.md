# Water Disribution Detector
In agriculture, it is crucial to have an uniform irrigation (water distribution over the farm) in order to maximize the farm's rendering. In this project, I prpose a novel method to evaluate a farm water distribution from satellite images and then calculate automatically the uniformity coefficient.
